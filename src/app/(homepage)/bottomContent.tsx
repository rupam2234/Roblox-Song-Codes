        How to use Roblox music codes in Boombox?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Using Roblox Music IDs is simple. First, join a game that allows you to
        play music using a Boombox. You&apos;ll need the Boombox game pass or
        the Twice Boombox for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once in the game, open your inventory and equip the Boombox. Games often
        have a specific key to open the Boombox menu; try pressing &apos;B&apos;
        by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you click on the Boombox gear, a GUI will appear. You&apos;ll see a
        music ID already displayed. To play your chosen music, click on the
        displayed ID, then copy your music ID from here and paste into the GUI
        using Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac). Finally, press the Play button. This will
        start playing the music.
