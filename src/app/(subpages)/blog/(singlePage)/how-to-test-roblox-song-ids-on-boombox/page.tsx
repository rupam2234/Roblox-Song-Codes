          Boombox is a virtual item that players can use to play music in
          various games within the Roblox platform. It functions much like a
          portable stereo or speaker within the Roblox world and let players

          and play those songs within the game environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to play music on Boombox you first need to find a game that
          offers Boombox gamepass. Games like &quot;

          Once you buy the Boombox gamepass for your prefered game, it will be
          added to your inventory. You can either open your inventory or
          character gear to find the Boombox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, select the Boombox from your inventory or gear menu. Your
          character will equip the Boombox immediately after you choose it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the Boombox is equipped, you can click on the boombox icon
          (usually at the bottom) to open the input field.

          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Some song IDs may not work on the Boombox
          because certain games have restrictions on playing certain music. Also
          be sure that the song IDs you use comply with Roblox&apos;s content
          guidelines. Playing extremely high-pitched music can also lead to
          being banned from the game or platform.
