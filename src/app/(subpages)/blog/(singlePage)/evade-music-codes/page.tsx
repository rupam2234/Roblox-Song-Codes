          If you are familiar with Evade, a popular Roblox game, you know
          playing it while listening to music is possible. Like many games in
          Roblox, Evade needs you to get their dedicated boombox player to be
          able to play music
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s unfortunate that copyrighted songs can no longer be used on
          the platform, but I see it as a positive change. Developers and
          players now have access to free, licensed audio, which encourages
          creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we can no longer listen to some great tracks on a virtual
          radio in-game, but there&apos;s Spotify for that!!!
        </p>

          The list above gives you plenty of songs to get started, but if you

          pick and play the song on Evade Boombox.{" "}

          Because all of the songs featured on this site are taken from the
          publically available official non-copyrighted library, they are meant
          to be running on Evade boombox too. You can find more song IDs on
          YouTube, Forums & Social Media too.

          Tips for Enhancing Your Evade Music Experience{" "}
        </h2>
        <p>
          While adding music codes in Evade is a fun way to personalize your
          gameplay, these extra tips can improve the experience further.
        </p>
        <ul className="terms-list space-y-3">
          <li>
            Create a set of codes for your favorite tracks that you can rotate
            during your gaming sessions. You can either use a notebook for this
            (my favorite for easier access to the codes) or create an online
            playlist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Call for different types of music in diverse situations. If
            you&apos;re trying to escape a tricky situation, faster, more
            energetic songs can heighten the intensity. On the other hand, if
            you are trying to strategize or are more composed, you may tend to
            choose slower tracks.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure your in-game and device volume are optimized. Sometimes, the
            music can overpower the game sounds, which are important for evading
            enemies. Adjust the volume to balance enjoying the music and staying
            alert to the in-game audio cues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By applying these tips, the music you will play will complement the
          game rather than spoil it. So go for it, try different music styles or
          any other sounds, and enjoy Evade like never before!
